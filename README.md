# React Admin

This repository is an SPA that I am building using React JS in front end supported by Laravel in the backend for API. 
The entire front end is based on the [Admin LTE](https://github.com/ColorlibHQ/AdminLTE) theme. 
I have not made any change in the CSS, and tried to replicate as much of the functionality as possible but using only React JS.

The application is completely developed in Typescript using the Create React App Typescript template.
